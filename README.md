SketchPlugins
=============

A git repo containing various plugins for [Sketch](http://bohemiancoding.com/sketch/).

## Installing and Updating
You can install these pretty easily just by cloning the Git repo:

```
$ cd ~/Library/Containers/com.bohemiancoding.sketch3/Data/Library/Application\ Support/com.bohemiancoding.sketch3/Plugins
$ git clone https://github.com/joshpuckett/SketchPlugins.git Puckins
```

Where “Puckins” is the name of the folder you want the plugins to live inside. They’ll also appear under that group in the Plugins menu in Sketch.

Updating is easy too!

```
$ cd ~/Library/Containers/com.bohemiancoding.sketch3/Data/Library/Application\ Support/com.bohemiancoding.sketch3/Plugins
$ git pull
```

## Included Plugins

### Text
Variety of plugins for working with text layers

* __Text to Uppercase__: takes a text layer and uppercases it.

### Align
Allows you to align layers inside another layer. This doesn't move the bottom selected layer, and is a better implementation I believe that how Sketch handles this currently (where they average the position of all selected layers).

* __Both in Selection__ (cmd option control x): aligns selected layers vertically and horizontally to the bottom most selected layer
* __Horizontally in Selection__ (cmd option control h): aligns selected layers horizontally to the bottom most selected layer
* __Vertically in Selection__ (cmd option control v): aligns selected layers vertically to the bottom most selected layer

### Save Page to PNG
Hit (Command + Option + Control + E) to save your entire page to a single PNG, in the same directory as your sketch file. This is super useful if you want to show all of your artboards at once.

### Handy

Handy is a plugin that makes working with guides easier in Sketch. It includes two plugins currently:
* __Add Guide__ (cmd shift option g): lets you add a vertical or horizontal guide at any point, for example 'v,100' adds a vertical guide at 100px. You can also pass multiple, space-separated values ('v,100 h,200').
* __Remove Guides__ (cmd shift option r): removes all guides across your artboards.

Note you need Rulers turned on (Control R) to see guides
